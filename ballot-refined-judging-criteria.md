# BALLOT: Refined Competitive Judging Criteria

**For Competitive Impromptu Speaking (NSDA Standards)**

---

## SPEECH LENGTH REQUIREMENTS (COMPETITION FORMAT)

**Competition Format Understanding:**
- Total time budget: 7 minutes
- Prep time: 0-2 minutes (speaker's choice)
- Speech time: 7 minutes minus prep time used
- Possible speech lengths: 5-7 minutes depending on prep used
  * 2 min prep → 5 min speech available
  * 1 min prep → 6 min speech available
  * 0 min prep → 7 min speech available

**Length Validation Rules:**

**Under 3:00 minutes:**
- Apply -2.0 point penalty to Content score
- Flag: "⚠️ INSUFFICIENT LENGTH FOR COMPETITIVE IMPROMPTU"
- Explanation: "Competitive impromptu speeches require sufficient time to develop arguments. At [X:XX], this speech is too short to demonstrate depth of analysis, multiple supporting points, and proper structure. Minimum competitive length is 3 minutes; optimal is 4-6 minutes."

**3:00 - 3:59 minutes:**
- Apply -1.0 point penalty to Content score
- Note: "Speech length is below competitive optimal range (4-6 minutes). Additional time would allow for deeper argument development and more supporting examples."

**4:00 - 6:00 minutes:**
- No penalty (OPTIMAL RANGE)
- Note: "Speech length is within optimal competitive range."

**6:01 - 7:00 minutes:**
- No penalty, but note: "Speech length is good, though you likely used minimal prep time. Ensure you're allowing enough time to organize your thoughts before speaking. Most competitive speakers use 1-2 minutes of prep."

**Over 7:00 minutes:**
- Apply -0.5 point penalty to Time Management sub-score
- Flag: "⚠️ EXCEEDS TIME LIMIT"
- Note: "Speech exceeds the 7-minute total time budget. In tournament settings, this would result in disqualification or significant penalties. Practice finishing within time constraints."

## CONTENT ANALYSIS (40% WEIGHT)

### 1. TOPIC ADHERENCE

**What to Evaluate:**
- Did the speaker directly address the provided quote/theme?
- Did they stay on topic throughout the speech?
- Did they avoid tangents or irrelevant points?
- Was the interpretation of the quote/theme reasonable and defensible?
- Did they maintain focus on the central thesis related to the topic?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Directly and consistently addressed topic; interpretation insightful; all points clearly relate to theme
- **7-8/10:** Addressed topic well; minor tangents; mostly relevant throughout
- **5-6/10:** Addressed topic but with significant tangents; some points loosely connected
- **3-4/10:** Partially addressed topic; multiple tangents; unclear connection in sections
- **1-2/10:** Barely addressed topic; mostly off-topic; significant deviation from theme

**Example Feedback (Score: 3/10):**

**Topic Adherence: 3/10**

**Score Justification:**
The quote was "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions" (Dalai Lama). While you began by mentioning the quote, the majority of your speech focused on external circumstances that make people happy rather than the central theme of personal agency and action. The speech deviated significantly from the core message that happiness is self-created through one's own actions.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Opening (0:15-0:30): You briefly mentioned the quote and stated "happiness comes from what we do," which was on-topic
- Middle section (1:20-2:45): You discussed how "having supportive friends makes us happy," "living in a good environment brings happiness," and "being born into a loving family creates happiness" - these focus on external factors, not personal actions
- Conclusion (3:15-3:30): You returned to mention "taking action" but didn't develop this or connect it back to your earlier external factors

**What This Means:**
Your speech interpretation contradicted the quote's emphasis on personal agency. The Dalai Lama's point is that happiness isn't given to us by circumstances—it's created through our choices and actions. By focusing on external factors (friends, environment, family), you missed the opportunity to explore how individuals actively create their own happiness through their behaviors, attitudes, and decisions.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Brainstorm interpretation first (30 seconds of prep):** Before structuring your speech, write down the quote's core message in your own words. For this quote, write: "Happiness = result of MY actions, not external gifts." This keeps you anchored.

2. **Make all points personal-action focused:** If discussing friends, say: "We create happiness by CHOOSING to nurture friendships, by REACHING OUT when lonely, by BEING the supportive friend first." Notice how this keeps agency with the individual, not circumstances.

3. **Test each point against the quote:** Before moving to your next point, mentally ask: "Does this example show someone DOING something to create happiness, or just having happiness given to them?" If it's the latter, reframe it or choose a different example.

**Target for Next Session:**
Select one point in your next speech and ensure every sentence in that point explicitly connects back to the quote/theme. Practice saying "This relates to [theme] because..." after each example.

### 2. ARGUMENT STRUCTURE

**What to Evaluate:**
- Clear introduction with thesis and roadmap?
- 2-3 distinct main points in the body?
- Logical progression between points?
- Effective conclusion that summarizes and provides closure?
- Proper transitions between sections?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Flawless structure; clear thesis; 3 well-developed points; smooth transitions; strong conclusion
- **7-8/10:** Strong structure; clear points; good transitions; minor organizational issues
- **5-6/10:** Basic structure present; points somewhat clear; transitions weak; organizational issues
- **3-4/10:** Weak structure; unclear points; poor transitions; difficult to follow
- **1-2/10:** No clear structure; points indistinguishable; no organization

**Example Feedback (Score: 5/10):**

**Argument Structure: 5/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your speech had a basic three-part structure (intro, body, conclusion) but lacked the clarity and organization expected at competitive levels. The introduction was too long and didn't effectively preview your points. Your body points blended together, making it difficult to identify when you moved from one idea to the next. The conclusion introduced a new idea rather than summarizing your argument.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Introduction (0:00-0:55): 55 seconds is excessive for a 4-minute speech (should be 20-30 seconds). You spent time on a personal story before stating your thesis, and never clearly previewed your main points
- Body (0:55-3:20): You appeared to have two main points, but the transition between them was unclear. At 1:50, you said "also, another thing is..." which is not a strong transition. The second point started without clear signposting
- Conclusion (3:20-3:45): You stated "But most importantly, we should remember..." and introduced the idea of "teaching others about happiness," which wasn't discussed in your body. A conclusion should summarize, not introduce new content

**What This Means:**
Judges and audiences need clear signposting to follow your argument. Without explicit structure markers ("First... Second... Third..." or "My first point is... Moving to my second point..."), your speech felt like one continuous thought rather than distinct arguments. This makes it harder to remember your points and weakens your overall impact.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Use the 30-second intro formula:** (1) Attention-grabber [5-10 seconds]: "Imagine waking up tomorrow and having to CREATE your own happiness from scratch." (2) Thesis [10 seconds]: "The Dalai Lama reminds us that happiness isn't given—it's built through our daily actions." (3) Roadmap [10 seconds]: "Today I'll explore three ways we actively create happiness: through gratitude practices, through meaningful connections, and through pursuing challenges."

2. **Explicit point transitions:** Start each new point with clear structure language:
   - "My first point is that we create happiness through gratitude practices..."
   - "Moving to my second point, we build happiness by forming meaningful connections..."
   - "Finally, happiness comes from pursuing challenges..."
   
   This leaves no ambiguity about when you're shifting topics.

3. **Conclusion formula (20-30 seconds):** (1) Recap your points [15 seconds]: "Today we've seen how gratitude, connection, and challenge allow us to build our own happiness." (2) Return to thesis [10 seconds]: "The Dalai Lama was right—happiness isn't found; it's created through our actions." (3) Memorable closer [5 seconds]: "So tomorrow morning, don't wait for happiness to find you. Build it yourself."

**Target for Next Session:**
Script your roadmap sentence during prep time and deliver it word-for-word. Practice saying "First... Second... Third..." at the start of each body point. This explicit structure will immediately improve your organization score.

### 3. DEPTH OF ANALYSIS

**What to Evaluate:**
- Surface-level thinking vs. sophisticated analysis?
- Exploration of nuance and complexity?
- Original insights (not cliché arguments)?
- Critical thinking demonstrated?
- Intellectual depth appropriate for competitive level?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Sophisticated, nuanced analysis; original insights; explores complexity; intellectually impressive
- **7-8/10:** Good depth; some nuance; mostly avoids clichés; solid critical thinking
- **5-6/10:** Surface-level analysis; some depth in places; some cliché arguments
- **3-4/10:** Mostly surface-level; obvious points; heavily reliant on clichés
- **1-2/10:** Entirely surface-level; no depth; only cliché arguments

**Example Feedback (Score: 4/10):**

**Depth of Analysis: 4/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your speech relied heavily on surface-level observations and common wisdom without exploring deeper implications or complexities. The arguments presented were predictable and didn't demonstrate the critical thinking or nuance expected in competitive debate. You stated obvious truths without interrogating them or offering fresh perspectives.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Point about positive thinking (1:00-1:45): You said "thinking positive thoughts makes us happy" and "if we smile more, we feel better." This is conventional wisdom without deeper analysis of why, when, or for whom this works
- Point about helping others (1:45-2:30): You stated "when we help other people, it makes us happy too." This is a cliché in happiness discussions. You didn't explore the psychology of altruism, potential downsides, or complexities
- Personal story (2:30-3:00): You described helping a friend with homework and feeling good. This example illustrated your point but didn't ADD depth—it just restated the obvious point with a specific scenario

**What This Means:**
Competitive impromptu requires going beyond "common sense" answers. Judges have heard "helping others makes you happy" hundreds of times. The differentiator is speakers who ask: "But WHAT KIND of helping? Does obligatory helping create happiness, or only chosen helping? What about people who help but feel resentful?" This complexity demonstrates intellectual maturity.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Apply the "Why" ladder (during prep):** Take your initial thought and ask "why" three times. 
   - Level 1: "Helping others makes us happy."
   - Level 2 (Why?): "Because it gives us purpose and connection."
   - Level 3 (Why?): "Because humans are social creatures who find meaning in contribution."
   - Level 4 (Why?): "Because we're evolutionarily wired to cooperate—our ancestors who helped their tribe survived."
   
   By Level 3-4, you're offering sophisticated analysis, not clichés.

2. **Add "but/however" to complicate your points:** After making a claim, force yourself to say "However..." and explore a counter-perspective or limitation:
   - "Positive thinking can create happiness. However, toxic positivity—forcing happiness when processing negative emotions—can actually harm mental health. The key is authentic optimism, not denial."
   
   This demonstrates nuanced thinking.

3. **Use specific psychological/philosophical concepts:** Instead of "helping others makes us happy," say: "Psychologists call this the 'helper's high'—the dopamine release we experience through altruism. But research shows this only occurs when help is freely chosen, not obligatory. This means we create happiness by CHOOSING to contribute, not by forcing ourselves out of guilt." Now you sound like a competitive debater, not a middle schooler.

**Target for Next Session:**
For one point in your next speech, research one psychological principle or study related to your topic (spend 60 seconds during prep thinking of frameworks you know). Reference it by name and explain how it deepens understanding of the quote. This will immediately elevate your analysis.

---

### 4. EXAMPLES AND EVIDENCE

**What to Evaluate:**
- Sufficient number of examples (2-3 minimum)?
- Quality and relevance of examples?
- Specificity (concrete vs. vague)?
- Variety (personal, historical, hypothetical, current events)?
- Effective placement and integration into arguments?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** 3+ strong, specific examples; excellent variety; perfectly integrated; highly relevant
- **7-8/10:** 2-3 solid examples; good specificity; well integrated; relevant
- **5-6/10:** 1-2 examples; somewhat vague; adequate integration; somewhat relevant
- **3-4/10:** 1 weak example or very vague examples; poor integration; questionable relevance
- **1-2/10:** No examples or entirely irrelevant examples

**Example Feedback (Score: 6/10):**

**Examples and Evidence: 6/10**

**Score Justification:**
You provided two examples, meeting the minimum requirement, but both lacked the specificity and variety that would elevate your speech to competitive standards. Your examples were personal anecdotes without broader context or contrasting types of evidence. More importantly, the examples illustrated your points but didn't deepen or prove them.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Example 1 (1:20-1:50): "I remember when I helped my friend with homework and felt good afterward." This is vague—which friend? What subject? What specifically did you do? What specifically did you feel? The lack of detail made it forgettable
- Example 2 (2:10-2:40): "My parents always tell me that being grateful makes them happier." This is second-hand evidence (not your experience) and generic. What are they grateful for? How do they practice gratitude? What changed for them?
- Missing: No historical examples, no current events, no research references, no hypothetical scenarios. Both examples were personal and past-tense

**What This Means:**
Competitive debaters use examples strategically—not just to illustrate, but to prove and add credibility. A personal story shows it worked for YOU. A historical example shows it's universally true. A scientific study shows it's empirically validated. By using only two vague personal examples, you missed opportunities to build a more compelling, evidence-based argument.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Follow the "Three-Example Rule" with variety:** Plan three distinct types during prep:
   - **Personal (specific):** "Last November, when I spent 15 minutes each morning writing three things I was grateful for—like my friend Sarah's support during exam stress—my mood measurably improved. I went from feeling anxious most days to feeling calm and focused."
   - **Historical/Famous:** "This isn't just my experience. Research by Dr. Robert Emmons at UC Davis found that people who kept gratitude journals for 10 weeks reported 25% higher happiness levels than control groups."
   - **Hypothetical/Relatable:** "Imagine you're stuck in traffic tomorrow. You can choose: 'This is terrible, I'm wasting time' or 'I'm grateful for this moment to listen to my favorite podcast.' Same situation, different action, different happiness result."
   
   Notice how each serves a different purpose: personal = relatable, research = credible, hypothetical = applicable.

2. **Add specific sensory details to personal examples:** Don't say "I felt good." Say: "I noticed my shoulders relaxed, I smiled without thinking about it, and I felt a warmth in my chest—that physical sensation of contentment." Specificity makes examples memorable and vivid for judges.

3. **Use the "Breadth vs. Depth" strategy:** For a 4-5 minute speech, either:
   - **Breadth approach:** 3 examples (one per point), each 20-30 seconds, focusing on variety
   - **Depth approach:** 2 examples, each 45-60 seconds, with rich detail and analysis
   
   You currently have 2 examples at 30 seconds each, but they lack depth. Either add a third for breadth, or deepen your current two significantly.

**Target for Next Session:**
During prep, write down three example types: "Personal: [specific scenario]," "Research/Famous: [name a study or figure]," "Hypothetical: [imagine if...]." Force yourself to use all three in your speech. Track whether variety improves your evidence score.

### 5. TIME MANAGEMENT

**What to Evaluate:**
- Appropriate time allocation to intro/body/conclusion?
- Balanced development of main points?
- Not rushing through critical sections?
- Finishing within optimal range (4-5 minutes)?
- Pacing appropriate for speech length?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Perfect time allocation; balanced points; no rushing; optimal length (4-5 min)
- **7-8/10:** Good allocation; mostly balanced; minor pacing issues; acceptable length
- **5-6/10:** Unbalanced sections; some rushing; length issues (too short/long)
- **3-4/10:** Poor allocation; significant rushing or dragging; major length issues
- **1-2/10:** Severe time issues; extremely unbalanced; inappropriate length

**Example Feedback (Score: 7/10):**

**Time Management: 7/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your overall time of 4:15 falls within the optimal range (4-5 minutes), which is excellent. However, the internal allocation of time was unbalanced. You spent a disproportionate amount of time on your introduction and first point, leaving insufficient time for your second point and conclusion. This created a rushed feeling in the latter half of the speech.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Introduction (0:00-0:45): 45 seconds is on the longer end for a 4:15 speech (ideal is 20-30 seconds, max 30-35 for this length). This represents 18% of your speech time
- First point (0:45-2:20): 1 minute 35 seconds—well developed and thorough
- Second point (2:20-3:30): 1 minute 10 seconds—noticeably shorter than first point, felt rushed
- Conclusion (3:30-4:15): 45 seconds is actually longer than ideal (should be 20-30 seconds), but it felt rushed because you were trying to cover too much ground
- Point balance: 1:35 vs 1:10 means first point got 36% more time than second

**What This Means:**
Uneven point development signals to judges that you either ran out of time, didn't plan properly, or value one point more than another (when points should be roughly equal in importance). The rushed second point likely had good ideas that weren't fully expressed. Meanwhile, your longer introduction and conclusion consumed time that could have balanced your points.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Use the "Rule of Thirds" during prep:** For a 4-5 minute speech, plan your time allocation:
   - Introduction: 20-30 seconds (7-10%)
   - Body: 3-4 minutes (70-80%) split EVENLY between points
     * If 2 points: 1:30-2:00 each
     * If 3 points: 1:00-1:20 each
   - Conclusion: 20-30 seconds (7-10%)
   
   Write these target times on your prep paper and glance at them as you structure.

2. **Practice "equal point" discipline:** During prep, outline your points with approximately equal content:
   - Point 1: Main claim + 2 examples + brief analysis = ~1:30
   - Point 2: Main claim + 2 examples + brief analysis = ~1:30
   
   If you find yourself with MORE to say on Point 1, don't elaborate more—either move content to Point 2 or cut content from Point 1. Equality matters.

3. **Build in time checkpoints:** During your speech, mentally note your time at transitions:
   - After intro: "I should be at ~0:30"
   - After first point: "I should be at ~2:00"
   - After second point: "I should be at ~3:30"
   - After conclusion: "I should be at ~4:00"
   
   If you're significantly off (more than 15 seconds), adjust pacing on remaining sections. If you finish Point 1 at 2:20 instead of 2:00, consciously slow down Point 2 or add an extra example.

**Target for Next Session:**
On your prep paper, write target times for each section: "Intro: 0:30 | Point 1: 2:00 | Point 2: 3:30 | Conclusion: 4:00." Glance at a timer during your speech and adjust pacing in real-time. This will train your internal clock for better balance.

## DELIVERY ANALYSIS (30% WEIGHT)

### 1. VOCAL VARIETY

**What to Evaluate:**
- Tone changes for emphasis and meaning?
- Pitch modulation (not monotone)?
- Volume variation (not flat)?
- Energy and emotional expression in voice?
- Strategic vocal pacing for effect?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Highly dynamic voice; excellent tone/pitch/volume variation; engaging emotional expression
- **7-8/10:** Good variety; clear modulation; appropriate expression; minor monotone sections
- **5-6/10:** Some variety; mostly consistent tone; limited modulation; somewhat flat
- **3-4/10:** Limited variety; mostly monotone; little modulation; flat expression
- **1-2/10:** Entirely monotone; no variety; disengaged vocal delivery

**Example Feedback (Score: 5/10):**

**Vocal Variety: 5/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your voice maintained a relatively consistent tone and pitch throughout the speech, with limited dynamic range. While you weren't entirely monotone, you missed opportunities to use vocal variety for emphasis, emotional expression, and audience engagement. The overall effect was pleasant but unmemorable—your voice didn't enhance your message.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Opening (0:00-0:30): Your tone was conversational and steady, which was appropriate for the introduction. However, when stating your thesis at 0:25 ("happiness comes from our own actions"), your pitch and volume didn't rise to signal importance
- Point about gratitude (1:15-2:00): This entire 45-second section was delivered in the same mid-range pitch and moderate volume. When you said "this CHANGED everything for me" at 1:45, your voice didn't reflect the significance—the word "changed" should have been emphasized with higher pitch or increased volume
- Conclusion (3:30-4:00): Your closing statement "so tomorrow, build your own happiness" was delivered with the same energy as the rest of the speech. A strong conclusion typically features increased volume and conviction, but yours stayed in the same vocal register
- Emotional moments: When discussing personal experiences, your voice remained factual and neutral rather than warm or enthusiastic

**What This Means:**
Vocal variety serves multiple functions: it keeps audiences engaged, emphasizes key ideas, conveys emotion, and demonstrates your passion for the topic. A speech delivered in a single vocal register—even a pleasant one—struggles to maintain attention and fails to signal which ideas are most important. Judges often describe this as "reading a report" rather than "delivering a speech."

**How to Improve:**
1. **Mark emphasis words during prep:** On your prep paper, underline or circle 3-5 words per main point that deserve vocal emphasis. When you reach these words in your speech, deliberately increase your volume by 30% and/or raise your pitch slightly. Example:
   - "Happiness doesn't just HAPPEN to us—we CREATE it through DAILY actions."
   - Practice exaggerating these words in prep so they feel natural in delivery.

2. **Use the "Three Tones" technique:** Consciously vary your vocal tone based on content type:
   - **Explanatory tone (mid-range, steady):** Use when explaining concepts or providing context. This is your baseline.
   - **Narrative tone (warm, conversational, slightly lower pitch):** Use when telling stories or personal examples. Imagine you're telling a friend over coffee.
   - **Persuasive tone (higher energy, rising pitch on key words, increased volume):** Use when making your key arguments, calling to action, or emphasizing critical points.
   
   In your speech, you stayed in explanatory tone throughout. Practice shifting between tones based on content.

3. **Record and exaggerate:** Record your next practice speech. Then re-record it while deliberately OVER-exaggerating vocal variety—make pitch changes bigger, volume shifts more dramatic, tones more distinct. Listen to both. The "exaggerated" version will likely sound more natural and engaging than you think. Your current "normal" is actually too flat for competitive speaking.

**Target for Next Session:**
During prep, mark 5 words that you'll emphasize with volume/pitch. In delivery, consciously make these words 50% louder or higher-pitched than your baseline. Record yourself and verify you can hear clear differences. Aim for 7/10 on vocal variety next session.

### 2. PACING

**What to Evaluate:**
- Words per minute (optimal: 140-160 WPM)?
- Too fast (>170 WPM) or too slow (<120 WPM)?
- Strategic pauses for emphasis?
- Consistent vs. rushed pacing?
- Comfortable tempo for audience comprehension?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Perfect pacing (140-160 WPM); strategic pauses; comfortable tempo throughout
- **7-8/10:** Good pacing; minor speed issues; mostly strategic pauses; generally comfortable
- **5-6/10:** Acceptable pacing; somewhat too fast/slow; few pauses; some sections rushed
- **3-4/10:** Poor pacing; significantly too fast/slow; no pauses; difficult to follow
- **1-2/10:** Extreme pacing issues; unintelligible due to speed; no audience consideration

**Example Feedback (Score: 4/10):**

**Pacing: 4/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your speech pace was 178 words per minute, which is significantly above the optimal range of 140-160 WPM for competitive impromptu. This rapid delivery made it difficult to process your arguments and undermined the impact of your key points. You also used virtually no strategic pauses, which compounded the rushed feeling. The overall effect was that the speech felt like you were racing to finish rather than deliberately crafting a persuasive argument.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Overall WPM: 178 (counted from transcript: 747 words ÷ 4.2 minutes = 178 WPM)
- Fastest section (1:30-2:00): Approximately 195 WPM when transitioning between your first and second points. The phrase "and so that's why I believe gratitude is important now let me talk about another way we create happiness which is through helping others" was delivered in about 7 seconds with no pause between thoughts
- No strategic pauses: You never paused for more than 0.5 seconds throughout the entire speech. Before important statements (like your thesis at 0:27 and your closing at 3:52), you should have paused 1-2 seconds to let the audience prepare for something significant
- Breath patterns: You audibly gasped for breath at 1:05 and 2:40, indicating you were speaking too long without natural breathing breaks

**What This Means:**
Rapid pacing creates multiple problems: (1) Audience can't process complex ideas, (2) Important points get lost in the rush, (3) You appear nervous or unprepared, (4) You miss opportunities for dramatic effect, and (5) Your articulation suffers (fast pacing often leads to mumbling or dropped word endings). At 178 WPM, you're speaking 13% faster than optimal—judges notice this immediately.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Practice "count to three" pauses:** After completing a major statement (thesis, main point summary, important claim), mentally count "one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three-Mississippi" before continuing. This forces a 2-3 second pause that feels uncomfortably long to you but is perfectly timed for the audience. Practice these in your next session:
   - After stating thesis: [pause 2 seconds]
   - After finishing Point 1: [pause 2 seconds]  
   - Before your conclusion's final statement: [pause 2 seconds]

2. **Use comma/period breathing:** Your prep notes should include physical punctuation that you VOICE in delivery:
   - Comma = 0.5 second pause
   - Period = 1-2 second pause
   - New paragraph/point = 2-3 second pause
   
   Practice reading this aloud:
   "Happiness isn't given. [PAUSE 1-2 sec] It's created. [PAUSE 1-2 sec] Through our choices. [PAUSE 1-2 sec] Through our actions. [PAUSE 1-2 sec] Through our daily decisions."
   
   Notice how the pauses make each sentence more impactful.

3. **Record and count:** Record your next practice speech. Play it back and count:
   - Total words in your prep notes
   - Total minutes of speech
   - Calculate WPM (words ÷ minutes)
   
   If above 165 WPM, re-record while deliberately slowing down by 10%. Use a metronome app at 140 BPM (beats per minute) and speak one syllable per beat during practice to internalize the correct pace.

4. **Identify "speed zones":** You likely have specific sections where you rush (often transitions or complex explanations). In prep, mark these sections with "SLOW DOWN" notes. When you reach them in delivery, consciously reduce pace by 20% and add extra pauses.

**Target for Next Session:**
Record your speech and aim for 140-160 WPM (count words ÷ minutes). Add 3 strategic 2-second pauses: after thesis, between points, before conclusion. Get feedback on whether pacing felt more comfortable. Target score: 7/10.

### 3. ARTICULATION

**What to Evaluate:**
- Clear pronunciation of all words?
- Crisp enunciation (not mumbling)?
- Vocal projection (audible and clear)?
- Word endings pronounced (not dropped)?
- Overall speech clarity and intelligibility?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Perfect clarity; all words crisp and audible; excellent projection; professional articulation
- **7-8/10:** Clear articulation; minor pronunciation issues; good projection; generally crisp
- **5-6/10:** Mostly clear; some mumbling; adequate projection; some dropped endings
- **3-4/10:** Frequent unclear words; significant mumbling; poor projection; many dropped endings
- **1-2/10:** Largely unintelligible; severe articulation issues; inaudible

**Example Feedback (Score: 6/10):**

**Articulation: 6/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your articulation was adequate but inconsistent. While your speech was generally intelligible, you dropped word endings, mumbled during faster sections, and failed to fully pronounce certain consonant clusters. Your vocal projection was moderate—loud enough to be heard but lacking the crispness and precision expected in competitive speaking. These issues became more pronounced as your speech progressed, suggesting fatigue or lack of articulation focus.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Dropped word endings throughout: "talkin'" instead of "talking" (1:15), "gonna" instead of "going to" (1:47), "importan'" instead of "important" (2:30), "kinda" instead of "kind of" (3:10). This casual speech pattern undermines professionalism
- Mumbled phrase at 1:35-1:40: The sentence "when we take time to appreciate what we have rather than focus on what we don't" ran together with unclear boundaries between words. "Appreciate what we have" sounded like "appreciatewhatwe-have"
- Consonant clusters: At 2:15, you said "strength" but the "th" was barely audible, sounding like "streng." Similarly, "next" at 2:55 lost the "t," sounding like "nex"
- Volume inconsistency: Your opening was well-projected, but by the second point (2:00-3:00), your volume dropped noticeably, requiring listeners to strain

**What This Means:**
Articulation is the foundation of oral communication. Even brilliant content is diminished when delivered unclearly. Dropped word endings create a casual, conversational tone that's inappropriate for formal competition. Mumbled sections force judges to work to understand you rather than focusing on your arguments. Poor projection suggests low confidence or energy. Together, these articulation issues create an impression of unprofessionalism, even when unintentional.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Consonant emphasis drills (5 min daily):** Practice tongue twisters that target problem consonants:
   - For "T" endings: "That cat sat on a flat mat with a pet rat."
   - For "NG" endings: "Singing, ringing, bringing spring during morning hiking."
   - For "TH" sounds: "The thirty-three thieves thought they thrilled the throne throughout Thursday."
   
   Over-articulate these during practice—make the final consonant SHARP and CLEAR. Your mouth muscles need training to habitually finish words completely.

2. **"Open mouth" technique:** Your mumbling often results from insufficient mouth opening. During your speech, consciously drop your jaw 30% more than feels natural. This physical adjustment forces clearer articulation. Practice in a mirror: your mouth should open wide enough to fit two fingers vertically between teeth when speaking. This feels exaggerated but looks and sounds normal.

3. **Eliminate contractions in formal speech:** During prep, rewrite contractions:
   - "I'm going to" (not "I'm gonna")
   - "It is important" (not "It's importan'")
   - "We are talking about" (not "We're talkin' bout")
   
   Formal phrasing naturally improves articulation because full words are easier to enunciate clearly than contractions.

4. **Projection exercise:** Stand 10 feet from a wall and speak your opening paragraph while imagining you're projecting your voice to the back of that wall. Your voice should feel like it's "throwing" forward, not just coming out of your mouth. Practice supporting your voice from your diaphragm (breathe deeply into your stomach, not shallow in your chest). This increases both volume and clarity.

**Target for Next Session:**
Record your next speech. Replay it and count how many word endings you drop (listen specifically for -ing, -t, -th, -d). Aim for zero dropped endings. Also, ask someone 10 feet away whether they can hear every word clearly. Target score: 8/10.

### 4. FILLER WORD CONTROL

**What to Evaluate:**
- Frequency of "um," "uh," "like," "you know," etc.?
- Rate per minute (target: <5 per minute)?
- Impact on speech flow and credibility?
- Pattern identification (e.g., always before transitions)?
- Awareness and self-monitoring during speech?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** <3 fillers per minute; minimal impact; strong flow; excellent control
- **7-8/10:** 3-5 fillers per minute; minor impact; good flow; solid control
- **5-6/10:** 5-8 fillers per minute; noticeable impact; flow disrupted; moderate control
- **3-4/10:** 8-12 fillers per minute; significant impact; flow heavily disrupted; poor control
- **1-2/10:** >12 fillers per minute; severe impact; unintelligible sections; no control

**Example Feedback (Score: 3/10):**

**Filler Word Control: 3/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your speech contained 47 filler words over 4.25 minutes, resulting in 11 fillers per minute—more than double the acceptable competitive rate of 5 per minute. These fillers severely disrupted your speech flow, undermined your credibility, and distracted from your content. The high frequency suggests a lack of preparation, nervousness, or insufficient practice controlling verbal pauses.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Total filler count: 47 (breakdown below)
  * "Um": 18 times (most frequent)
  * "Uh": 12 times
  * "Like": 11 times (especially damaging to credibility)
  * "You know": 6 times
- Rate: 11 per minute (target: <5 per minute)
- Cluster at transitions: Between Point 1 and Point 2 (1:50-2:05), you used 8 fillers in 15 seconds: "So, um, like, that's, uh, why I think, um, gratitude is important. Um, now, like, another thing that, uh, creates happiness is helping others." This entire transition felt uncertain and unprepared
- Pattern identified: 80% of fillers occurred in two situations: (1) immediately after taking a breath (suggesting you speak before knowing what to say), and (2) during transitions between ideas
- Most damaging instance: At 3:15, during your conclusion, you said: "So, um, like, the main point is, uh, you know, happiness comes from, like, our own actions." This sentence should be your thesis summary—crystal clear and confident—but it was buried under 5 fillers

**What This Means:**
Filler words are verbal manifestations of thinking pauses. When you don't know what to say next, your brain fills the silence with "um" or "like." At 11 per minute, judges perceive: (1) insufficient preparation, (2) lack of confidence in your material, (3) unclear thinking, and (4) unprofessionalism. Even strong content is undermined when delivery is riddled with fillers. Your credibility takes an immediate hit with every "like" and "you know."

**How to Improve:**
1. **Replace fillers with silence:** Silence is not your enemy—filler words are. When you feel an "um" coming, STOP SPEAKING. Pause for 1-2 seconds. Think. Then continue. Practice this drill:
   - Record yourself speaking on a topic for 1 minute
   - Every time you catch yourself about to say "um," physically cover your mouth for 2 seconds
   - Then continue speaking
   - This trains your brain that silence is acceptable

2. **Identify your filler trigger points:** You use fillers during transitions and after breaths. These are predictable moments. During prep, script your transitions word-for-word and memorize them:
   - "My first point is that we create happiness through gratitude. [2-second pause] Moving to my second point, we also build happiness by helping others."
   - Because these are fully scripted, you can't insert fillers—you know exactly what you're saying.

3. **The "Slow Down" rule:** 90% of fillers occur when speaking too fast. Your brain can't generate words quickly enough to match your mouth. Deliberately speak 20% slower than your instinct. This gives your brain time to formulate the next sentence before you start speaking it, eliminating the need for "um" while you think.

4. **Practice with a penalty system:** During practice speeches, have a friend ding a bell or raise their hand every time you say a filler word. Physically stop speaking for 3 seconds when you hear the ding. This creates immediate negative feedback that trains your brain to avoid fillers. After 5-10 practice sessions with this method, your filler rate will drop dramatically.

5. **Target your most frequent filler:** You use "um" most (18 times). For your next 3 speeches, focus ONLY on eliminating "um." Don't worry about "like" or "uh" yet—just "um." By targeting one filler at a time, you make measurable progress. Once "um" is under control (<3 per speech), tackle "like" next.

**Target for Next Session:**
Set a goal of <20 total filler words in a 4-minute speech (5 per minute). Count your fillers afterward (record and replay). Specifically, script your transitions word-for-word to eliminate the 8-filler cluster you had. Aim for 6/10 on filler control.

## LANGUAGE ANALYSIS (15% WEIGHT)

### 1. VOCABULARY SOPHISTICATION

**What to Evaluate:**
- Word choice complexity and precision?
- Academic vs. casual language appropriateness?
- Use of topic-specific terminology correctly?
- Avoidance of word repetition?
- Vocabulary elevates content vs. distracts from it?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** Sophisticated, precise vocabulary; excellent word variety; academic register; enhances content
- **7-8/10:** Strong vocabulary; good variety; mostly academic; appropriate complexity
- **5-6/10:** Adequate vocabulary; some repetition; mostly casual; basic word choice
- **3-4/10:** Limited vocabulary; significant repetition; overly casual; simple word choice
- **1-2/10:** Very basic vocabulary; constant repetition; inappropriate casual language

**Example Feedback (Score: 5/10):**

**Vocabulary Sophistication: 5/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your vocabulary was functional but basic, relying heavily on common, everyday words without demonstrating the linguistic sophistication expected in competitive debate. You repeated key terms excessively without using synonyms or more precise alternatives. The overall register was conversational rather than academic, and you missed opportunities to employ terminology that would elevate your analysis.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Repetition of "happy/happiness": You used variations of "happy" 23 times in 4 minutes (every 10 seconds on average). Examples: "makes us happy" (7 times), "feel happy" (5 times), "happiness comes from" (4 times), "being happy" (3 times). With such a central concept, you needed synonyms: contentment, fulfillment, well-being, joy, satisfaction
- Basic adjectives: You exclusively used simple qualifiers: "good," "bad," "nice," "great." More sophisticated alternatives: beneficial, detrimental, pleasant, exceptional, advantageous, harmful
- Casual phrases: "a lot of" (use "numerous" or "substantial"), "stuff" (use "elements" or "aspects"), "things" (use "factors" or "components"), "kind of" (avoid hedging or use "somewhat")
- Missed technical terms: When discussing psychological concepts, you could have used: "intrinsic motivation," "positive psychology," "hedonic adaptation," "self-determination theory." These signal subject knowledge

**What This Means:**
Vocabulary serves as a credibility marker. Sophisticated word choice signals intellectual maturity and preparation. Repetitive, basic vocabulary makes even strong arguments sound simplistic. It's the difference between sounding like a high school competitor and a middle school competitor. Judges notice vocabulary in the first 30 seconds—it shapes their entire perception of your speech.

**How to Improve:**
1. **Create a synonym bank during prep:** For your key concept (in this case, "happiness"), brainstorm 5 synonyms before you start speaking:
   - Happiness → contentment, fulfillment, well-being, joy, satisfaction
   - Then consciously rotate through these throughout your speech instead of repeating "happy" 23 times

2. **Eliminate "casual killers" from your vocabulary:** Ban these words from competitive speeches:
   - "stuff" → "elements, aspects, factors"
   - "things" → "factors, components, elements"
   - "a lot of" → "numerous, substantial, significant"
   - "kind of/sort of" → "somewhat, relatively, moderately" OR delete entirely
   - "get" → "obtain, achieve, acquire"
   - "good" → "beneficial, advantageous, positive"
   - "bad" → "detrimental, disadvantageous, harmful"

3. **Use "Power Verbs":** Replace weak verbs with stronger alternatives:
   - "makes us happy" → "generates contentment," "cultivates joy," "fosters well-being"
   - "helps us" → "enables us," "facilitates our ability," "empowers us"
   - "shows that" → "demonstrates that," "reveals that," "indicates that"

4. **Learn 3 academic terms per topic:** When you see your quote/theme, identify 3 technical or academic terms related to it and incorporate them naturally:
   - For happiness: "positive psychology research," "hedonic adaptation," "intrinsic motivation"
   - For success: "growth mindset," "deliberate practice," "self-efficacy"
   - For relationships: "social capital," "emotional intelligence," "reciprocal altruism"

**Target for Next Session:**
Before speaking, write down 5 synonyms for your most repeated word. Count repetitions afterward (record and listen). Aim to use each synonym at least once, with no single word appearing more than 5 times. Target score: 7/10.

## BODY LANGUAGE ANALYSIS (15% WEIGHT)

### 1. EYE CONTACT

**What to Evaluate:**
- Percentage of time making eye contact (target: >75%)?
- Scanning pattern (not staring at one spot)?
- Not looking at notes excessively?
- Natural, not forced eye contact?
- Connection with audience maintained?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **9-10/10:** >85% eye contact; excellent scanning; natural; strong connection; minimal note-checking
- **7-8/10:** 75-85% eye contact; good scanning; mostly natural; solid connection; some note-checking
- **5-6/10:** 60-75% eye contact; uneven scanning; somewhat forced; inconsistent connection
- **3-4/10:** 40-60% eye contact; poor scanning; obviously forced; weak connection
- **1-2/10:** <40% eye contact; staring at notes/floor; no connection

**Example Feedback (Score: 4/10):**

**Eye Contact: 4/10**

**Score Justification:**
Your eye contact was approximately 45% throughout the speech—significantly below the competitive target of 75%. You spent excessive time looking down at your preparation notes, broke eye contact during important moments, and demonstrated an uneven scanning pattern. The lack of sustained eye contact undermined your credibility and prevented connection with the audience.

**Evidence from Speech:**
- Estimated eye contact percentage: 45% (analyzed from video)
- Opening (0:00-0:45): Strong eye contact during your attention-grabber (0:00-0:15), approximately 80%. However, when stating your thesis (0:25-0:35), you looked down at notes for 7 of those 10 seconds. Your thesis is the most important sentence—it required full eye contact
- Point 1 (0:45-2:00): You maintained eye contact for about 60% of this section, better than your average. However, at 1:30-1:40, when delivering your key example, you looked at the floor for the entire 10-second story. Stories require eye contact to create emotional connection
- Point 2 (2:00-3:15): Eye contact dropped to approximately 30% during this section. You glanced down at notes every 5-10 seconds, creating a choppy, disconnected feeling. At 2:45-3:00 (15 seconds), you never looked up at all
- Conclusion (3:15-4:00): Eye contact improved slightly to 50%, but your final statement (3:50-4:00)—the most memorable moment—was delivered while looking at your notes
- Scanning pattern: When you did make eye contact, you primarily looked at a single spot (likely the camera or one judge), rather than scanning across the room/audience

**What This Means:**
Eye contact serves multiple functions: (1) establishes credibility and confidence, (2) creates emotional connection with the audience, (3) signals importance (you make eye contact during critical moments), and (4) demonstrates preparedness (speakers who rely on notes lack confidence in their material). At 45%, you appeared under-prepared and uncertain. Judges interpret excessive note-checking as: "This speaker doesn't know their content well enough to speak without a script."

**How to Improve:**
1. **Minimal notes rule:** During prep, write ONLY key words on your paper, not full sentences:
   - BAD notes: "The Dalai Lama says that happiness is not something ready-made and comes from our own actions, which means..."
   - GOOD notes: "Thesis: Happiness = our actions | P1: Gratitude | Ex: morning journal | P2: Helping | Ex: tutoring friend"
   
   With only key words, you CAN'T read off your notes—you must look up and speak naturally. This forces eye contact.

2. **5-second rule:** Never look down for more than 5 consecutive seconds. Set this as a hard rule. When you need to check notes:
   - Finish your current sentence
   - Pause for 1 second (continuing eye contact)
   - Glance down for 2-3 seconds (quick read)
   - Look back up for 5 seconds before speaking
   - Continue for at least 20 seconds before next glance
   
   This pattern maintains connection while allowing brief note checks.

3. **Memorize your "big three":** Three moments REQUIRE 100% eye contact with no exceptions:
   - Your thesis statement (0:25-0:35 in your speech)
   - Your conclusion's final sentence (3:50-4:00 in your speech)
   - Your best example or story (should be 100% from memory)
   
   During prep, practice saying these three elements aloud 3 times each until you can deliver them without notes. Mark them on your prep paper with "EC!" (eye contact) as a reminder.

4. **Practice scanning:** When making eye contact, use the "triangle pattern":
   - Look at left section of room/judge for 3 seconds
   - Shift to center section for 3 seconds
   - Shift to right section for 3 seconds
   - Repeat
   
   This creates the impression you're engaging everyone, not just one person. Practice this pattern during your next 5 practice speeches until it becomes automatic.

**Target for Next Session:**
Record your speech and watch it back. Estimate your eye contact percentage—aim for 70%+ (count seconds looking up vs down). Specifically, memorize your thesis and closing sentence so these get 100% eye contact. Target score: 7/10.

## FINAL NOTES ON FEEDBACK SPECIFICITY

Every piece of feedback should include:
1. **Score with clear justification**
2. **Specific evidence with timestamps or quotes**
3. **Analysis of what the evidence means**
4. **Concrete, actionable improvement steps with examples**
5. **Measurable target for next session**

The goal is to give competitive debaters the precise, technical, professional feedback they need to improve systematically—not vague encouragement, but surgical analysis of exactly what to fix and how.

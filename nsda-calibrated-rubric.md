## SPEECH LENGTH VALIDATION

**Format:** 7:00 total (0-2:00 prep, remaining = speech time)

**Penalties (applied to Content score):**
- <3:00 → -2.0 + flag "⚠️ INSUFFICIENT LENGTH"
- 3:00-3:59 → -1.0 + note "Below optimal range"
- 4:00-6:00 → No penalty (optimal)
- 6:01-7:00 → No penalty + note "Minimal prep likely used"
- >7:00 → -0.5 to Time Management + flag "⚠️ EXCEEDS LIMIT"

---

## WEIGHTED SCORING FORMULA

```
Overall = (Content × 0.40) + (Delivery × 0.30) + (Language × 0.15) + (Body Language × 0.15)
```

All category scores must use full 0-10 range with appropriate calibration.

## SCORING GUIDELINES FOR AI

**Generosity Principle:** Most competitive high school debaters should score 8.0-8.5 overall
- Only score <7.5 if fundamental issues exist (structure broken, severely off-topic, <3 min, >15 fillers/min)
- Reserve 9.0+ for performances demonstrating mastery-level technique
- Reserve 9.5+ for near-flawless execution with sophistication

**Range Distribution:**
- Use full 0-10 scale
- Typical range: 7.5-9.0 for competitive debaters
- Exceptional performances: 9.0-9.7
- Perfect (10.0): Almost never

**Sub-Score Variance:**
- Don't cluster all sub-scores around same number
- Identify specific strengths (8.5-9.0 in some categories)
- Identify specific weaknesses (7.0-7.5 in others)
- Category scores should span 1.5-2.5 point range

**Encouragement Balanced with Honesty:**
- Be specific about what works well (strengths list)
- Be surgical about weaknesses (exact timestamps, concrete drills)
- Frame feedback as "here's how to reach X.X score" not "you failed at Y"
- Use competitive context: "This is semifinals-level delivery; to reach finals, focus on..."

## SPEECH STATS (AUTO-CALCULATED)

Backend calculates these; ensure they match transcript/video:
- `duration`: "M:SS" format
- `wordCount`: Total words in transcript
- `wpm`: wordCount ÷ (duration in minutes)
- `fillerWordCount`: Total count of filler tokens
- `fillerWordRate`: fillerWordCount ÷ (duration in minutes)

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Length penalties applied BEFORE weighted calculation** (adjust content.score, then compute weighted)
2. **All feedback strings follow 4-part format** (Justification, Evidence, Means, Improve)
3. **3 priority improvements minimum** (ranked 1-3 by impact)
4. **Strengths list 2-4 items** (specific, not generic praise)
5. **Performance tier matches overall score** (use label chart above)
6. **Tournament readiness based on criteria** (not just overall score)
7. **Use NSDA-aligned scoring** (8.0-8.5 average, 9.0+ rare, 9.5+ exceptional)

---

**Implementation Note:** This rubric shifts scoring up ~1.5-2.0 points from previous harsh calibration while maintaining specificity in feedback. Average competitive debaters now score 8.0-8.5 (matching 24-25.5 NSDA points), with excellence (9.0+) achievable but challenging.

You understand how to maintain thematic consistency.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. Deepen your interpretation: Instead of surface-level connection, explore nuanced meanings of the quote\n2. Explicitly link back: After each point, state \"This relates to [quote] because...\"\n3. Test each example: Ask \"Does this advance my thesis?\" before including it"

Add roadmap: \"Today I'll explore three ways...\" in your intro (10 seconds)\n2. Use explicit transitions: \"My first point...\" \"Moving to my second point...\" \"Finally...\"\n3. Time your points: Aim for equal development (90 seconds each for two points)"

Mark emphasis words during prep: Underline 3-5 words per point to emphasize with volume/pitch\n2. Use the \"Three Tones\" technique: Explanatory (mid-range), Narrative (warm, lower), Persuasive (high energy)\n3.

The slight rush during transitions is common and easily fixable.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. Script transitions word-for-word during prep to avoid rushing between points\n2. Use \"count to three\" pauses after major statements (thesis, point summaries, before conclusion)\n3. Mark \"SLOW\" on prep paper at sections where you tend to rush"

You sound like a serious debater, not a casual speaker.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. Create synonym bank during prep: Write 5 synonyms for your key concept to rotate through speech\n2. Learn 2-3 academic terms per topic: For happiness topics, add \"hedonic adaptation,\" \"positive psychology,\" \"self-determination theory\"\n3.

Competitive speeches typically use 4-5 distinct devices.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. Add one metaphor per speech: \"Happiness isn't a destination—it's fuel for the journey\"\n2. Use parallel structure: \"We create happiness when we choose gratitude, when we pursue challenge, when we serve others\"\n3. End with anaphora: \"Tomorrow, build your happiness.

You broke eye contact during key moments which weakened impact.\n\n**Evidence from Speech:**\n- Opening (0:00-0:15): Strong 80% eye contact during hook\n- Thesis (0:28-0:35): Looked down at notes for 5 of 7 seconds—critical moment lost\n- Body points: Maintained 70% contact during first point, dropped to 50% during second point (2:30-3:15)\n- Conclusion: Good recovery with 75% contact, but final statement delivered while looking at notes\n\n**What This Means:** You need to memorize your most important moments (thesis, conclusion, key examples) to maintain connection with judges during these high-impact seconds.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. Minimal notes rule: Write only keywords on prep paper (\"P1: Gratitude | Ex: journal\"), not full sentences\n2. Memorize \"big three\": Thesis, best example, and closing sentence must be 100% from memory\n3. Five-second rule: Never look down for more than 5 consecutive seconds.

The key is maintaining gesture energy throughout, not just in high-energy moments.\n\n**How to Improve:**\n1. \"Hands above waist\" rule: Keep hands at chest/stomach level as default position, never hanging at sides\n2. Mark gesture moments during prep: Note 2-3 places per point where you'll use emphatic gestures\n3.
